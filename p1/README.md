# Project 1: First Interpreter

This was a project for EECS 662 Programming Languages Class. I was tasked to
implement three different eval functions as well as an interpret function
that used the evalMonad function in order to create an interpreter for the
simple arithmatic language *KULANG*.

To compile: `ghc p1.hs`
